package com.watabou.glwrap;

//This class exists because the back-end OpenGL implementation (written in C)
// supports VBO operations (along with the rest of GLES 2.0) since android 2.2 (Froyo, api 8),
// but for some reason the Java calls for these methods were only added in 2.3 (Gingerbread, api 9)

//So this class is here specifically to reference an armabi/x86 compiled binary
// which gives us Java hooks for VBOs on android 2.2

//...I don't know what google engineer forgot to put the java hooks in android 2.2 back in 2010,
// but you know who you are and this class is your fault.

//Compiled binaries for the FroyoGLES20Fix lib are included in this project, which means that
// the android NDK is not required for building Shattered Pixel Dungeon.
// see SPD-classes/src/main/jniSources/README.txt for more details.

//DO NOT REFERENCE THIS CLASS ON DEVICES API 9 AND ABOVE, use android.opengl.GLES20 instead.
