# Pixel Dungeon Rescue

A Roguelike RPG, with randomly generated levels, items, enemies, and traps!
Forked from [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon)
which itself is based on the [source code of Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/pixel-dungeon-gradle), by [Watabou](https://www.watabou.ru).

Pixel Dungeon Rescue is essentially a light reskinning of Shattered, where the player characters are trying to rescue and cure a dark magic infestation ravaging the dungeon.
It is meant for people (younger children) who might not be interested in lots of killing to still enjoy a roguelike game.
I suspect it is unlikely to be of interest to serious roguelike gamers.
I plan to keep it current with bugfixes and enhancements from the upstream project.

Pixel Dungeon Rescue currently compiles for Android and desktop platforms.
If anyone is interested in doing an iOS version, I'd be happy to merge, or else include pointers to your project!
