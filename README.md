# Sofia Station

Sofia Station is a sci-fi total conversion mod of [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://shatteredpixel.com/shatteredpd/), transforming the fantasy roguelike dungeon crawler into a futuristic space station adventure.

## About

Sofia Station reimagines the classic dungeon crawling experience in a sci-fi setting:
- **Magic becomes Technology**: Wands are now emitters, spells are programs, and enchantments are modifications
- **Heroes become Operatives**: Play as Marines, Scientists, Snipers, and other space station personnel
- **Dungeons become Station Decks**: Explore corrupted station levels instead of medieval dungeons
- **Fantasy becomes Sci-Fi**: All text, lore, and terminology has been converted to fit the sci-fi theme
