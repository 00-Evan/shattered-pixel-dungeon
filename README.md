# Pixel Dungeon Rescue

## The Story

Many years ago, Pixel City was enveloped by a dark magic, which made
all the creatures of the countryside wild and full of rage. A
brilliant wizard, Yendor, created a powerful artifact - an amulet that
could pull this dark magic from a creature and store it inside
itself. "No biggie", said Yendor, "I'm just gonna save the world!"

Yendor went about the country, curing all the creatures she could
find, until they were all restored, and the amulet was full. Yendor
and her fellow wizards created a vault deep underground where the
amulet could be stored, for they had not yet devised a way to safely
destroy it.

Since that time, the vault was damaged, and the dark magic began to
leak out, infesting the subterranean creatures. Fortunately, the
wizard had not been idle. They now had devices that could dispel the
magic, and they built these devices into ordinary weapons. Once a
creature has been cleaned of dark magic, they can be beamed to the
surface, rehabilitated, and release to the wild. But someone has to go
underground to clean the dark magic from these creatures.

Guess what - they picked you!

Go down underground, cleansing whatever creatures you find. Then, make
your way to the value, retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, and return it to
the surface so its magic too can be cleansed.

Don't worry if you succumb to the attacks of the creatures below - if
you get too damaged, you will be beamed to the surface, healed, and
you can try again.

No biggie, you're just gonna save the world!

## The App

A Roguelike RPG, with randomly generated levels, items, enemies, and traps!
Forked from [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon)
which itself is based on the [source code of Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/pixel-dungeon-gradle), by [Watabou](https://www.watabou.ru).

Pixel Dungeon Rescue is essentially a light reskinning of Shattered, where the player characters are trying to rescue and cure a dark magic infestation ravaging the dungeon.
It is meant for people (younger children) who might not be interested in lots of killing to still enjoy a roguelike game.
I suspect it is unlikely to be of interest to serious roguelike gamers.
I plan to keep it current with bugfixes and enhancements from the upstream project.

Pixel Dungeon Rescue currently compiles for Android and desktop platforms.
If anyone is interested in doing an iOS version, I'd be happy to merge, or else include pointers to your project!
