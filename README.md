# Windswept Pixel Dungeon

A Roguelike RPG, with randomly generated levels, items, enemies, and traps! Based on the [source code of Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon), by [00-Evan](https://www.shatteredpixel.com).

Windswept Pixel Dungeon is intended to be a "spiritual successor" to the 1990s duo, [Castle of the Winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_of_the_Winds). A functional web port of the original games is available [online](https://game.castleofthewinds.com) in case you are interested in playing a more direct reproduction of the original titles.

If you'd like to work with the code, you can find the following guides in `/docs`:
