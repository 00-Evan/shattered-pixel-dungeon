	 * each clustering pass is basically a 3x3 mask filter but with rounding to true or false
	 * high clustering values will produce more concentrated patches,
	 * but any amount of clustering will rapidly push fill rates towards 1.0f or 0.0f
	 * The closer the fill rate is to 0.5f the weaker this pushing will be.
	 *
	 * forceFillRate adjusts the algorithm to force fill rate to be consistent despite clustering.
	 * this is achieved by firstly pulling the initial fill value towards 0.5f
	 * and then by manually filling in or emptying cells after clustering, until the fill rate is
	 * achieved. This is tracked with the fillDiff variable.
