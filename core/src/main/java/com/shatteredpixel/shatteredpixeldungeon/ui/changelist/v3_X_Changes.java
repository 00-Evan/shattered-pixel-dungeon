The original Warrior splash was the first one Aleks did, and so this remake is the most significant of the hero splash art changes. Aleks was keen to make corrections to armor design and proportions to bring the splash up to his current standards.",

				"**-** Broken Seal shield no longer passively builds, it now triggers all at once just before the Warrior gets damaged to 50% health or lower.\n" +

				"**- Lethal Defence** talent now reduces seal cooldown, instead of recharging seal shield.\n" +
				"**- Gladiator** will retain any active shielding from his broken seal as long as he has combo.\n" +

				"\n" +
				"**Quest Score** can now be reduced in a similar manner to boss score. Make sure to position well to avoid penalties! This reduction includes telegraphed attacks/effects (e.g. crystal spire, gnoll geomancer), and regular attacks that you should be able to always avoid (e.g. rot lashers, fetid rat's ooze).
