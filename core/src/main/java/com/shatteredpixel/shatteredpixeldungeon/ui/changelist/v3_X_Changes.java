This is partly intended because he is meant to be the most simple, but I do think there are some changes that can be made so that the Warrior's class ability is a bit more visible and interactive. This is not going to be a hero rework, but rather some targeted changes to improve the Warrior's game feel without making him much harder for new players to use."));

I expect to make those changes in v3.1 after taking a little time to gather feedback and gameplay data from v3.1."));

In addition to the usual bugfixes and smaller QoL tweaks, I might add a couple of smaller content additions such as new trinkets and other items, a new rare enemy, etc."));

				"\n" +
				"**Android 4.0-4.4:** Due to updates to Shattered's game library (libGDX) and Google Play's billing library, I will sadly have to drop support for these older Android versions toward the end of 2025. These Android versions should still get v3.1 and v3.2 though.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"**Java 8-10:** This only affects users who play the old desktop JAR distribution, which requires a separate Java install. Support for the Java 8, 9, and 10 targets has been depreciated, at some point in the future Shattered will require Java 11 instead. I'll likely make this change at the same time as the Android change."));
