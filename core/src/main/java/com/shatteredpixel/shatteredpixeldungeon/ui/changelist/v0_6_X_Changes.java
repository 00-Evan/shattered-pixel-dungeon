In both of these earlier iterations glyphs had big trade-offs, which led many players to dislike or outright ignore them. I finally just decided to make them like enchantments. With that, plus the new augmentation functionality, armor finally had some of the variability in stats and effects that weapons had, though adding full blown armor types is still a common suggestion.\n" +
