This made the game run much smoother.\n" +

Upgrading armor was already seen as optional by many players prior to v0.4.0, and so after v0.4.0 armor was beginning to be seen as almost useless! I had always intended to try and better balance armor vs. weapons, but after v0.4.0 I realized that I needed to make it a top priority.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"Aside from the obvious numbers changes in this update, I also made armor much more reliable. In Shattered damage calculations have always used a 'triangular distribution', where the middle value is the most likely result, and the max or min are quite rare. Armor didn't use this prior to v0.4.1, which meant that even highly upgraded armor could be quite unreliable. Since v0.4.1, and other updates like v0.8.0, I now feel that armor is well-balanced versus weapons."));
