windows.wndstory.sewers=The Dungeon lies right beneath the City, its upper levels actually constitute the City's sewer system.\n\nAs dark energy has crept up from below the usually harmless sewer creatures have become more and more dangerous. The city sends guard patrols down here to try and maintain safety for those above, but they are slowly failing.\n\nThis place is dangerous, but at least the evil magic at work here is weak.
windows.wndstory.prison=Many years ago a prison was built here to house dangerous criminals. Tightly regulated and secure, convicts from all over the land were brought here to serve time.\n\nBut soon dark miasma started to creep from below, twisting the minds of guard and prisoner alike.\n\nIn response to the mounting chaos, the city sealed off the entire prison. Nobody knows what became of those who were left for dead within these walls...
windows.wndstory.caves=The caves, which stretch down under the abandoned prison, are sparcely populated. They lie too deep to be exploited by the City and they are too poor in minerals to interest the dwarves. In the past there was a trade outpost somewhere here on the route between these two states, but it has perished since the decline of Dwarven Metropolis. Only omnipresent gnolls and subterranean animals dwell here now.
windows.wndstory.city=Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of dwarven city-states. In its heyday the mechanized army of dwarves has successfully repelled the invasion of the old god and his demon army. But it is said, that the returning warriors have brought seeds of corruption with them, and that victory was the beginning of the end for the underground kingdom.
windows.wndstory.halls=In the past these levels were the outskirts of Metropolis. After the costly victory in the war with the old god dwarves were too weakened to clear them of remaining demons. Gradually demons have tightened their grip on this place and now it's called Demon Halls.\n\nVery few adventurers have ever descended this far...
