journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.title=Introduction
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.body=Greetings Adventurer!\n\nYou have just purchased (or looted) the amazing Adventurer's Guide to Dungeoneering! This guidebook is full of tips, tricks, and advice to help budding adventurers survive and excel!\n\nWhile you can read this guide all at once, it is best used as a reference. Make sure to check it whenever you're struggling.\n\nKeep your wits about you, and remember:\nDON'T PANIC!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.title=Identifying Items
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.body=Identifying items can be just as important as finding them!\n\nThe colors on potions and glyphs on scrolls are different in each dungeon, so you won't know what effect you'll get if they're unidentified.\n\nUnidentified equipment can be upgraded if you're lucky, or it might be cursed! Accidentally equipping a cursed item is bad, but usually isn't instant doom.\n\nScrolls of identify, upgrade, or remove curse are very useful if you want to reduce the risk of unidentified items.\n\n(You can find a list of all the items you've identified in the items tab of your journal)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining_and_searching.title=Examining and Searching
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining_and_searching.body=Charging forward recklessly is a great way to get killed.\n\nThere's always time to slow down and examine things around you, which can help you figure out the best way to approach a situation. Rushing into enemies is almost never the best way to deal with them.\n\nDungeons are full of secret passages and traps which appear invisible at first glance. It's good to be willing to thoroughly search an area if you suspect something is hidden.\n\n(The magnifying glass button is used for examining and searching. Tap it once and then tap on something to examine, tap it twice to search the area around you.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.title=Strength and Upgrades
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.body=There won't be any time to train with weapons and armor you find in the dungeon, so you'll need brute strength to use them effectively.\n\nPotions of Strength directly enhance your physical might and are the most effective way to meet the requirements of higher tier gear. \n\nScrolls of Upgrade are primarily for making equipment stronger, but also reduce weight. However each upgrade will be less effective at reducing weight than the last.\n\nDon't try and rush to be able to equip the heaviest item you can find. It's usually better to gradually work up equipment tiers, rather than die trying to go all-in on something you can't use for a long time.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.title=Dealing with Hunger
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.body=Using food effectively is one of the best things you can do to improve your odds of survival.\n\nHunger ultimately affects your health: you will slowly heal when satiated and slowly lose health when starving. Losing health may sound bad, but as long as you don't die losing health has no direct penalty.\n\nIt's best to think of health and hunger as resources that need to be managed, not kept full at all times. If you have lots of health, there's no harm in going hungry. If your health is low, keeping full can help you restore it.\n\nIf you pace out when you eat based on how your health is doing, your food should last much longer!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.title=Gaining Experience
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.body=As you defeat enemies your level of experience will increase. Your experience determines how accurate your attacks are, how easily you can dodge, and how much health you have.\n\nYour experience level makes a big difference in combat. It's best to be at a level that's at least the same as your current dungeon depth.\n\nIt can be tempting to rush through a dungeon, avoiding exploration and combat, but you should do your best to explore each floor thoroughly. If you don't, you will deprive yourself of both supplies and experience.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.title=Surprise Attacks
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.body=You should seize every opportunity to use the environment to your advantage in combat, and surprise attacks are one of the best ways to do this.\n\nOne of the most common parts of the environment you can use to surprise attack is a door. Simply retreat behind the door and strike your enemy right after they move into it. They won't be able to evade your attack!\n\nBaiting enemies into a door is especially helpful when dealing with ranged foes. You will both get a surprise attack, and force them to get close to you.\n\n(When you successfully land a surprise attack, a yellow exclamation mark will briefly appear ontop of the enemy you just hit)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.title=Handling Defeat
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.body=If a situation is looking grim, there's no shame in running away. Stairs between floors are especially helpful for this, as enemies usually won't be willing to follow you through them.\n\nIf all else fails, make sure to keep this guidebook safe, so that it will be passed on to whoever finds your body!\n\n(Don't be dissuaded if you are dieing a lot. You shouldn't expect to get very far in your first few tries, this game is hard! Focus on learning the game and steadily improving, don't focus on winning right away.)
