When you get to your shift tonight, check Tengu's cell, then get out.\n\nDoesn't matter if the prisoners try and escape, pretty soon nobody will be able to leave this place.\n\nThat freak has to stay secured though, if he escapes there's no telling what he'll do, just make sure tengu's cell is locked, then get out.\n\nDon't bother looking for me after this, a captain must go down with his ship.\n- Warden Smith
