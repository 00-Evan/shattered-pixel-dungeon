journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.title=Bevezetés
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.body=Greetings Adventurer!\n\nYou are reading the amazing Adventurer's Guide to Dungeoneering! This guidebook is full of tips and tricks to help budding adventurers survive and excel!\n\nWhile you can read this guide all at once, it is best used as a reference. Make sure to check it whenever you're struggling.\n\nKeep your wits about you, and remember:\nDON'T PANIC!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.title=Tárgyak megismerése
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.body=Identifying items can be just as important as finding them!\n\nThe colors on potions and glyphs on scrolls are different in each dungeon, so you won't know what effect you'll get if they're unidentified.\n\nUnidentified equipment can be upgraded if you're lucky, or it might be cursed! Accidentally equipping a cursed item is bad, but usually isn't instant doom.\n\nScrolls of identify, upgrade, or remove curse are very useful if you want to reduce the risk of unidentified items.\n\n(You can find a list of all the items you've identified in the items tab of your journal)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining_and_searching.title=Keresés és vizsgálódás
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining_and_searching.body=Charging forward recklessly is a great way to get killed.\n\nThere's always time to slow down and examine things around you, which can help you figure out the best way to approach a situation. Rushing into enemies is almost never the best way to deal with them.\n\nDungeons are full of secret passages and traps which appear invisible at first glance. It's good to be willing to thoroughly search an area if you suspect something is hidden.\n\n(The magnifying glass button is used for examining and searching. Tap it once and then tap on something to examine, tap it twice to search the area around you)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.title=Erő és fejlesztések
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.body=There won't be any time to train with weapons and armor you find in the dungeon, so you'll need brute strength to use them effectively.\n\nPotions of Strength directly enhance your physical might and are the most effective way to meet the requirements of higher tier gear. \n\nScrolls of Upgrade are primarily for making equipment stronger, but also reduce weight. However each upgrade will be less effective at reducing weight than the last.\n\nIt's important to work towards heavier, high tier items, but don't completely ignore equipment you can use sooner as well.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.title=Az éhség kezelése
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.body=Using food effectively is one of the best things you can do to improve your odds of survival.\n\nHunger ultimately affects your health: you will slowly heal when satiated and slowly lose health when starving. Losing health may sound bad, but as long as you don't die losing health has no direct penalty.\n\nIt's best to think of health and hunger as resources that need to be managed, not kept full at all times. For example, if you have full health, the health regen you get from being full will be wasted.\n\nIf you pace out when you eat based on how your health is doing, your food should last much longer.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.title=Tapasztalatszerzés
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.body=As you defeat enemies your level of experience will increase. Your experience determines how accurate your attacks are, how easily you can dodge, and how much health you have.\n\nYour experience level makes a big difference in combat. It's best to have at least one level for each floor of the dungeon.\n\nIt can be tempting to rush through a dungeon, avoiding exploration and combat, but doing so will deprive you of both supplies and experience.\n\n(You can see information about your hero, including exp, on the status pane at the top of the game interface. Tap on your hero portrait to get even more info)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.title=Rajtaütés
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.body=A rajtaütés az egyik legjobb módja annak, hogy felülkerekedj a harcban.\n\nEz olyankor történik, ha nem vagy a megtámadott lény tátóterében vagy épp akkor látott meg. A rajtaütés elől még a leghajlékonyabb ellenségek sem tudnak elhajolni!\n\nAz egyik leggyakoribb, rajtaütésre használható tereptárgy az ajtó. Az ellenség ki van téve a rajtaütésnek, ha épp a csukott ajtón átlépéskor éri támadás.\n\n(A sikeres rajtaütéskor egy sárga felkiáltójel villan fel a megsebzett ellenfél fölött.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.title=A kudarc elkerülése
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.body=If a situation is looking grim, there's no shame in running away. Escaping to another part of the dungeon can give you some time to recover before trying again.\n\nUnfortunately, dungeoneering is a very dangerous profession and most adventurers will eventually meet their demise. While luck can definitely play a role, the best adventurers are the ones who use every little trick to improve their odds.\n\n(Don't be dissuaded if you are dying a lot. You shouldn't expect to get very far in your first few tries, this game is hard! Focus on learning the game and steadily improving, don't focus on winning right away.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.title=Hatékony fosztogatás
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.body=Specific rooms will often contain better loot than others. Some of these rooms will be behind locked doors, or will contain obstacles which must be navigated past.\n\nWhenever an obstacle like this blocks your progress, look for a solution nearby. Whether it's a key or something more crafty, there is usually a tool you can use on the same floor.\n\nPotions of strength and scrolls of upgrade are an excellent measure of how well you're exploring and looting. You will be able to find 3 scrolls of upgrade and 2 potions of strength per dungeon region.\n\n(You can see a list of important landmarks and unused keys in the notes tab of the journal window.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.title=Mágikus támadások
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.body=Magical attacks cut right through armor and are extremely difficult to dodge.\n\nThis means that damage you deal with wands will be very reliable, but also makes magical enemies extremely dangerous.\n\nMagical attacks always have a caveat though. In the case of wands it's their limited charges, wands become almost useless if they aren't given time to recharge. Magic that enemies use will always have some form of weakness as well. \n\nWhen facing enemies that use magic it is extremely important to figure out how to evade their magic, rather than just eating the damage from it.

journal.document.alchemy_guide.title=Alchemy Guide
journal.document.alchemy_guide.potions.title=Creating Potions
journal.document.alchemy_guide.potions.body=Welcome to Practical Applications of Alchemy!\n\nThis book serves as a recipe reference for hobbyist alchemists and adventurers looking to get their hands dirty.\n\nWe will start with the most iconic alchemy recipe: Place any three seeds into an alchemy pot to brew a potion!\n\nEvery seed type has a potion counterpart. The potion you create may relate to one of the seeds used, but there is a chance it will be random as well. Using multiple of the same type of seed will decrease the chance for a random potion.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.stones.title=Creating Runestones
journal.document.alchemy_guide.stones.body=Mixing a single scroll into an alchemy pot will imbue its magic into two or three rocks within the pot. This creates runestones that correspond to that scroll.\n\nRunestones are a lesser variant of scrolls, just as seeds are a lesser variant of potions. Unlike seeds however, runestones cannot be combined to make a scroll.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.darts.title=Tipping Darts
journal.document.alchemy_guide.darts.body=A single seed can be combined with one or two darts to tip them. Each type of seed produces its own type of tipped dart, with a unique effect.\n\nTipped darts only last for one use however, and will revert to regular darts when recovered.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotics.title=Exotic Potions and Scrolls
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotics.body=The power of a potion or scroll can be augmented to create a new 'exotic' variant. These exotic items have more powerful effects, but they are often useful in different ways as well.\n\nCombining a potion and any two seeds will produce an exotic potion. Combining a scroll with any two runestones will produce an exotic scroll.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy.title=Alchemical Energy
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy.body=While the recipes we have discussed so far only need their ingredients, some recipes require energy from the alchemy pot itself. This Energy is a limited resource, but can be used to make recipes that are more than the sum of their ingredients. Some recipes will require a small amount of energy, some require a lot.\n\nAll further recipes discussed in this book will make use of Alchemical Energy.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.food.title=Food Recipes
journal.document.alchemy_guide.food.body=Not all recipes involve magical potions or scrolls, some are more traditional.\n\nRaw meat can be stewed in an alchemy pot, and the pot's energy will cleanse the meat of disease. The more meat that is used at once, the greater the efficiency of the recipe.\n\nA raw blandfruit can be combined with a seed to create a cooked blandfruit. The cooked fruit will emulate whatever potion the seed corresponds to.\n\nA pasty, full ration, and a piece of meat (any type will do) can be combined to create a feast! Feasts provide an unparalleled culinary experience, but cost a fair amount of energy.

journal.document.alchemy_guide.heal_elixirs.title=Healing Elixirs

journal.document.alchemy_guide.aoe_brews.title=Area of Effect Brews
journal.document.alchemy_guide.aoe_brews.body=Area of effect brews spread a harmful effect over a large area.

The energy in these crystals can be channeled to cast spells! Most spells have multiple uses, but the specific amount varies by spell.\n\nTeleportation spells contain magic that changes the positioning of yourself, enemies, or items in various useful ways.\n\n\nMagical porter is created by mixing a scroll of mirror image with a merchant's beacon.\n\nPhase shift is created by mixing a scroll of teleportation with a scroll of terror.\n\nBeacon of returning is created by mixing a scroll of passage, a scroll of magic mapping, and a lot of alchemical energy.
