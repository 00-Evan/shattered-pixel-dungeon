actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.intro_quest_duelist=Hey Human! You look like a brave one.
actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.intro_quest_cleric=Hey Human! You look like an important one.
actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.intro_quest_start=Wanna be useful, eh? Yeah I got something you could do. I built dis workshop ontop of an old mine, it's just down dat ladder. Take dis pickaxe and mine me some _dark gold ore. 40 pieces_ should be enough. The rock down der is nice and soft so _you'll be able to mine through the walls with some effort._\n\nWhat do you mean, how am I gonna pay? You greedy...\n\nOk, ok, I can do some smithin' for you. Consider yourself lucky, I'm the only blacksmith around.
actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.intro_quest_crystal=Careful though, the mine's dangerous for a little human like you. It's been abandoned for a while, and bunch of crystals have started growing. They're shiny, but too fragile to be worth anythin', and they've got some energy things protecting 'em. They're pretty strong, so _be careful where you mine_ or you'll get their attention.\n\nThere's a _giant crystal_ somewhere too. It's a lot tougher, so be prepared for a fight if you start breakin' it. I'll bet smashing it will slow all the crystal growth down though, so I'll pay extra if you can do it.
actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.intro_quest_gnoll=Careful though, the mine's dangerous for a little human like you. Some gnolls want the gold too and now they're wreckin' the place.

You'll have to mine through it, so _look for recently disturbed rock._\n\nI think one of the gnolls is causing most of the trouble, probably a _geomancer shaman_ or somethin'. I'll pay extra, if you can find and kill it, but I'm sure it'll fight back.
actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.intro_quest_fungi=Careful though, the mine's dangerous for a little human like you. There's some sorta fungus monster that's been growing down there. It's got mushroom sentries that're really deadly if they see you, but they can't get up and chase you at least. _Keep out of sight_ if you want to stay alive.\n\nI'll pay extra if you can manage to take down the _biggest mushrom,_ but it'll take some real effort. It's connected to a bunch of mycelium nodes that're hidden in the walls. You'll have to break most of 'em before you can really damage it.

actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.exit_warn_med=You done? You've got some gold at least, but there's definitely more in the mine. You should be able to get _40 pieces._\n\n_Remember, I'm not lettin' you back in once you come up._
actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.exit_warn_high=You done? Looks like you've got a good amount of gold, but I could use a bit more. You should be able to get _40 pieces._\n\n_Remember, I'm not lettin' you back in once you come up._
actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.exit_warn_full=You done? You've got lots of gold, but make sure you haven't left any of your gear behind.\n\n_Remember, I'm not lettin' you back in once you come up._

actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_prison_huntress=You seem to be out of your element miss. Tight Station corridors aren't as spacious as grand halls or the forests surrounding the city are they? Hehe, oh don't mind my rambling, why not buy something?
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_prison_duelist=Well if it isn't the travelling hero! If you're trying to save another town then good luck, the dangers here are much worse than petty bandit gangs. I'm sure you'll do better than anyone else could, just try to not die right outside my store.
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_prison_cleric=Well hello there Your Highness, or is it Your Holiness now? Hehe, either way this is no place for you, a lot of people would be quite distraught if you wound up dead. Surely you have some coins though, why not buy something to help prevent that?
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_caves=Spend money, live longer.\n\nOh and say hello to that disfigured engineer for me if you see him. Remind the lug that he still owes me money for that hammer I sold him last week!
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_city=My wares can keep you safe down here.\n\n...And don't loiter if you please. It took forever to get the locals down here to leave me alone, I don't want you attracting any trouble!
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_halls=Hey there, I've got special prices for demon hunters!\n\nOh and be careful down there! The demons below won't care how courageous you are. You can't come back up and spend more money if you're dead! ;)\n\nAre the demons like me? Hehe, not at all. I'm just a small fellow, not much of a fighter, and I've managed to keep my mind intact. The demons below are much stronger things, and they've all been enslaved by... well... just be careful down there.
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_ascent=I don't know what you're planning to do with that amulet but I want no part of it. Buy something and move on, we both need to leave this place!
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.desc=This stout guy looks more appropriate for a trade district in some large city than for a Station. His prices explain why he prefers to do business here.

actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.name=old emitter expert
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_warrior=Oh, hello there! What a pleasant surprise to meet a warrior from the north in such a depressing place! You must have travelled quite far to get here. If you're looking for adventure, I may have a task for you.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_rogue=Oh Goodness, you startled me! I haven't met a bandit from this place that still has his sanity, so you must be from the surface! If you're up to helping a stranger out, I may have a task for you.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_mage=Oh, hello %s! I heard there was some ruckus regarding you and the scientists institute? Oh never mind, I never liked those stick-in-the-muds anyway. If you're willing, I may have a task for you.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_huntress=Oh, hello miss! A friendly face is a pleasant surprise down here isn't it? In fact, I swear I've seen your face before, but I can't put my finger on it... Oh never mind, if you're here for adventure, I may have a task for you.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_duelist=Oh, hello miss! What a pleasant surprise to meet an operative in such a depressing place! If you're up to helping an old man out, I may have a task for you.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_cleric=Oh, hello Your Highness! What a pleasant surprise to meet you in such a depressing place! I hate to impose, but I may have a task for you.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_1=\n\nI came here to find a rare ingredient for a emitter, but I've gotten myself lost, and my energy shield is weakening. I'll need to leave soon, but can't bear to go without getting what I came for.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_dust=I'm looking for some _corpse dust._ It's a special kind of corrupted bone meal that usually shows up in places like this. There should be a barricaded room around here somewhere, I'm sure some dust will turn up there. Do be careful though, the corruption the dust carries is quite potent, _get back to me as fast as you can_ and I'll cleanse it for you.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_ember=I'm looking for some _fresh embers_ from a newborn fire elemental. Elementals usually pop up when a construction ritual isn't controlled, so just find some candles and a ritual site and I'm sure you can get one to pop up. You'll want to _avoid boxing yourself in_ while fighting it though, or you could _keep some sort of freezing item handy._ Newborn Elementals are pretty powerful and chaotic, but they can't stand the cold.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_berry=The old warden of this prison kept a _rotberry plant,_ and I'm after one of its seeds. The plant has probably gone wild by now though, so getting it to give up a seed might be tricky. Its garden should be somewhere around here. Try to _keep away from its vine lashers_ if you want to stay in one piece. Using fire might be tempting but please don't, you'll kill the plant and destroy its seeds.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_2=\n\nIf you can get that for me, I'll be happy to pay you with one of my finely crafted emitters! I brought two with me, so you can take whichever one you prefer.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.reminder_dust=Any luck with corpse dust, %s? Look for some barricades.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.reminder_ember=Any luck with those embers, %s? You'll need to find four candles and the ritual site.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.reminder_berry=Any luck with a Rotberry seed, %s? Look for a room filled with vegetation.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.def_verb=blocked
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.desc=This old yet hale gentleman wears a slightly confused expression. He is protected by a energy shield.



###mobs
actors.mobs.acidic.name=acidic scorpio
actors.mobs.acidic.desc=These huge arachnid-like demonic creatures avoid close combat, preferring to fire crippling serrated spikes from long distances. This one appears to be dripping with corrosive ooze.

actors.mobs.albino.name=albino rat
actors.mobs.albino.desc=This is a rare breed of marsupial rat, with pure white fur and jagged teeth.
actors.mobs.albino.discover_hint=You can rarely find this enemy in a specific region of the Station.

actors.mobs.armoredstatue.name=armored statue
actors.mobs.armoredstatue.desc=You would think that it's just another one of this Station's inanimate statues, but its red glowing eyes give it away.\n\nIt seems to be in great condition because of the armor it's wearing, it might be very hard to kill.
actors.mobs.armoredstatue.desc_arm_wep=While the statue itself is made of stone, the _%1$s_ and _%2$s_ it's wielding look real.

actors.mobs.bandit.name=crazy bandit
actors.mobs.bandit.desc=An elite thief, distinguished by their more opulent purple robe. Despite their greater skill, they've become just as mindless as regular thieves.\n\nIn addition to stealing from you, crazed bandits will briefly blind, cripple, and poison you! They're much more likely to be carrying extra loot than a regular thief though.

actors.mobs.bat.name=vampire bat
actors.mobs.bat.desc=These brisk and tenacious inhabitants of the caves are much more dangerous than they seem. They replenish their health with each successful attack, which allows them to defeat much larger opponents.

actors.mobs.bee.name=golden bee
actors.mobs.bee.desc_honey=Despite their small size, golden bees tend to protect their home fiercely. This one has been placated, and seems to want to follow you.
actors.mobs.bee.desc=Despite their small size, golden bees tend to protect their home fiercely. This one is very mad, better keep your distance.
actors.mobs.bee.discover_hint=You can find this character with a specific item.

actors.mobs.brute.name=gnoll brute
actors.mobs.brute.enraged=enraged
actors.mobs.brute.def_verb=blocked
actors.mobs.brute.desc=Brutes are the largest, strongest, and toughest of all gnolls. When mortally wounded, they go berserk, gaining temporary shielding and a large boost to damage.
actors.mobs.brute$bruterage.name=brute rage
actors.mobs.brute$bruterage.desc=This gnoll brute is dying, but wants to take you with it!\n\nThe brute will die when its shielding wears off, either due to time or if it is damaged. In the meantime, it will deal hugely increased damage, so watch out!\n\nShield remaining: %d.

actors.mobs.causticslime.name=caustic slime
actors.mobs.causticslime.desc=This slime seems to have been tainted by the dark energy emanating from below. It has lost its usual green color, and drips with caustic ooze.
actors.mobs.causticslime.discover_hint=You can rarely find this enemy in a specific region of the Station.

actors.mobs.crab.name=sewer crab
actors.mobs.crab.desc=These huge crabs are at the top of the food chain in the sewers. They are extremely fast and their thick carapace can withstand heavy blows.

actors.mobs.crystalguardian.name=crystal guardian
actors.mobs.crystalguardian.def_verb=blocked
actors.mobs.crystalguardian.desc=These large crystalline guardians almost look like statues, if it weren't for their bright glowing eyes. The hardened crystal they're made out of causes them to be sluggish but very tough, so _it's best to leave them to sleep in their crystal nest for as long as possible._\n\nDue to their size, crystal guardians will move much more slowly in enclosed spaces. They're also so durable that they're impossible to kill outright. They can be beaten down and temporarily disabled, but they'll just get back up again after a little while.
actors.mobs.crystalguardian.discover_hint=You can find this enemy during a specific quest.

actors.mobs.crystalmimic.name=crystal mimic
actors.mobs.crystalmimic.ate=The mimic ate your %s!
actors.mobs.crystalmimic.escaped=The crystal mimic has escaped!
actors.mobs.crystalmimic.desc=Mimics are energetic creatures which can take any shape they wish. In Stations they almost always choose a shape of a treasure chest, in order to lure in unsuspecting visitors.\n\nCrystal mimics are trickier than their regular cousins, and prefer to avoid conflict while stealing loot. They will attempt to sprint away once discovered, and have the ability to reposition enemies when they attack.

actors.mobs.crystalspire.name=crystal spire
actors.mobs.crystalspire.warning=The crystal vibrates as you strike it. Keeping this up is bound to draw attention to you...
actors.mobs.crystalspire.alert=The vibration grows and rumbles through the whole cave!
actors.mobs.crystalspire.desc=This gigantic spire of ultra hard crystal is probably the source of all the strange crystalline creatures in this cave. Your regular weapons are ineffective against it, so you'll need to use your pickaxe if you want to destroy it.\n\n_Make sure you're prepared before you start breaking it._ Such a big crystal is likely to take a while to mine through, and you probably won't be able to do it undisturbed. The spire itself may even have some means of defending itself as well. _Perhaps the spire's own attacks could be used against its minions._
actors.mobs.crystalspire.discover_hint=You can find this enemy during a specific quest.

actors.mobs.crystalwisp.name=crystal wisp
actors.mobs.crystalwisp.beam_kill=The beam of light killed you...
actors.mobs.crystalwisp.desc=A small angry floating chunk of hardened crystal that's producing a bright glow. While not especially strong, crystal wisps will shoot a damaging beam of light at you if they have a clear shot.\n\nWisps are small enough to easily move through the various crystal outcroppings, but they aren't able to shoot through them.
actors.mobs.crystalwisp.discover_hint=You can find this enemy during a specific quest.

actors.mobs.demonspawner.name=demon spawner
actors.mobs.demonspawner.on_death=The demonic energy here seems to lessen as the spawner dies.
actors.mobs.demonspawner.desc=This twisting amalgam of prototech flesh is responsible for creating ripper demons from the prototechs that have died in this region. Clearly the demons see no issue with using every resource they can against their enemies.\n\nWhile visually terrifying, demon spawners have no means of moving or directly defending themselves. Their considerable mass makes them hard to kill quickly however, and they will spawn ripper demons more quickly when they are under threat.\n\n_Demon spawners seem to be connected to some central source of demonic power. Killing them may weaken it._

actors.mobs.dm100.name=DM-100
actors.mobs.dm100.zap_kill=The lightning bolt killed you...
actors.mobs.dm100.desc=The DM-100 is an early model of prototech 'defense machine' which was designed to protect prototech miners in the caves below this prison. Their electrical shocks proved too weak however, and so they were gifted to the human city above. They went unused for years and eventually found their way to the prison, where the warden initially deemed them too cruel to use. However, as the prisoners became more unruly they became a necessity.

actors.mobs.dm200.name=DM-200
actors.mobs.dm200.vent=The DM-200 fires a jet of toxic exhaust!
actors.mobs.dm200.desc=The DM-200 is the second generation of prototech 'defense machine', which was designed to protect prototech miners in the caves and city below. They are much larger and bulkier than their predecessors, and attack with devastating hydraulic fists.\n\nTheir increased size is also their primary weakness, as they are unable to fit into the narrow tunnels and doorways of the Station. The prototechs were able to compensate for the DM-200's lack of mobility by allowing them to vent their toxic exhaust fumes at distant enemies, or enemies they cannot reach.

actors.mobs.dm201.name=DM-201
actors.mobs.dm201.vent=The DM-201 lobs a corrosive grenade!
actors.mobs.dm201.desc=The prototechs briefly experimented with more heavily emphasizing the DM-200's lack of mobility and created some DM models that are entirely stationary. The DM-201 is a retrofitted DM-200 which acts as a sentry turret that has no movement ability. In exchange for the lack of mobility, DM-201s have significantly more durability and attacking power.\n\nAs DM-201s have no engine to vent exhaust from, the prototechs instead outfitted them with corrosive gas grenades! DM-201s are careful with these grenades however, and will only lob them when attacked from a distance.

actors.mobs.dm300.name=DM-300
actors.mobs.dm300.notice=UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL DETECTED!
actors.mobs.dm300.shield=DM-300 pulls power from the exposed wires and shields itself!

actors.mobs.dm300.def_verb=blocked
actors.mobs.dm300.defeated=CRITICAL DAMAGE! ATTEMPTING SHUTDO-
actors.mobs.dm300.desc=The DM-300 is the largest and most powerful 'defense machine' that the prototechs ever built. Such an awesome machine is difficult to manufacture, so the prototechs only ever made a few to guard the entrances to their underground metropolis.\n\nIt is equipped with vents to jet its toxic exhaust fumes and a high power drill that it can use both to attack and disrupt the earth. DM-300 can also connect to an energy grid, further enhancing its power.
actors.mobs.dm300.desc_supercharged=DM-300 is currently charged full of electrical energy. In this form DM-300 cannot be damaged and moves at double speed! Additionally, its drill now spins fast enough for it to _tunnel through solid rock,_ though it moves much more slowly when doing this.\n\nAttacking DM-300 directly is pointless while it is supercharged, but _something in the area must be providing it with this energy,_ destroying that may weaken it.

actors.mobs.dwarfking.name=King of prototechs
actors.mobs.dwarfking.notice=How dare you! You have no idea what you're interfering with!

actors.mobs.dwarfking.losing=No! You can't do this... you have no idea what lies below...
actors.mobs.dwarfking.defeated=You've... Doomed us all...
actors.mobs.dwarfking.rankings_desc=Fell Before the leader of prototechs
actors.mobs.dwarfking.desc=Many years ago one of the highest scientists in the prototech court uncovered secrets which gave him tremendous power over life and death. He soon put this power to use, subjugating and corrupting his peers, his leader, and eventually every prototech citizen. Now he is leader, ruler over a legion of undead subjects.\n\nThe leader of prototechs is an aggressive foe, who will attempt to surround and overwhelm his enemies with his horde of undead minions.
actors.mobs.dwarfking$dkghoul.rankings_desc=Fell Before the leader of prototechs
actors.mobs.dwarfking$dkmonk.rankings_desc=Fell Before the leader of prototechs

actors.mobs.ebonymimic.hidden_name=suspicious outline
actors.mobs.ebonymimic.hidden_desc=There seems to be something here, but it's almost totally transparent.
actors.mobs.ebonymimic.desc=Mimics are energetic creatures which can take any shape they wish. In Stations they almost always choose a shape of a treasure chest, in order to lure in unsuspecting visitors.\n\nEbony mimics are stealthy mimics with the ability to make themselves almost invisible. They lurk on things that visitors are likely to interact with, but do contain loot of their own as well. They aren't any tougher than a regular mimic once discovered, but their surprise bite is devastating.
actors.mobs.ebonymimic.discover_hint=You can find this enemy with a specific trinket.

actors.mobs.elemental$fireelemental.name=fire elemental
actors.mobs.elemental$fireelemental.desc=Elementals are chaotic creatures that are often created when powerful occult technology isn't properly controlled. Elementals have minimal intelligence, and are usually associated with a particular type of magic.\n\nFire elementals are a common type of elemental which deals damage with fiery energy. They will set their target ablaze with melee attacks, and can occasionally shoot bolts of fire as well.
actors.mobs.elemental$newbornfireelemental.name=newborn fire elemental
actors.mobs.elemental$newbornfireelemental.charging=The elemental is charging up!
actors.mobs.elemental$newbornfireelemental.desc=Elementals are chaotic creatures that are often created when powerful occult technology isn't properly controlled. Elementals have minimal intelligence, and are usually associated with a particular type of magic.\n\nThis fire elemental is freshly constructed, but still quite dangerous!
actors.mobs.elemental$newbornfireelemental.desc_boss=Because of the chaotic nature of its construction, this elemental can only spread fire in inaccurate blasts after charging for a turn.
actors.mobs.elemental$newbornfireelemental.desc_ally=Because this elemental was constructed by a spell, it has a little more control over its flame. It's incapable of making ranged attacks, but will ignite enemies it attacks in melee.
actors.mobs.elemental$newbornfireelemental.discover_hint=You can find this enemy during a specific quest.
actors.mobs.elemental$frostelemental.name=frost elemental
actors.mobs.elemental$frostelemental.desc=Elementals are chaotic creatures that are often created when powerful occult technology isn't properly controlled. Elementals have minimal intelligence, and are usually associated with a particular type of magic.\n\nFrost elementals are a common type of elemental which weakens enemies with chilling energy. They will chill their target with melee and occasional ranged attacks. Their magic is much more effective in water.
actors.mobs.elemental$shockelemental.name=shock elemental
actors.mobs.elemental$shockelemental.desc=Elementals are chaotic creatures that are often created when powerful occult technology isn't properly controlled. Elementals have minimal intelligence, and are usually associated with a particular type of magic.\n\nShock elementals are a less common type of elemental which disrupts its enemies with electricity and flashes of light. In melee they will arc electricity to nearby enemies, and deal bonus damage to their primary target if they are in water. They will also occasionally focus a ranged blast of light at their target, temporarily blinding them.
actors.mobs.elemental$chaoselemental.name=chaos elemental
actors.mobs.elemental$chaoselemental.desc=Elementals are chaotic creatures that are often created when powerful occult technology isn't properly controlled. Elementals have minimal intelligence, and are usually associated with a particular type of magic.\n\nChaos elementals are rare and dangerous elementals which haven't stabilized to a particular element. They will unleash wild unpredictable energy when they attack.

actors.mobs.eye.name=evil eye
actors.mobs.eye.deathgaze_kill=The deathgaze killed you...
actors.mobs.eye.desc=Evil Eyes are floating balls of pent up demonic energy.

actors.mobs.fetidrat.name=fetid rat
actors.mobs.fetidrat.desc=Something is clearly wrong with this rat. Its greasy black fur and rotting skin are very different from the healthy rats you've seen previously. Its pale green eyes make it seem especially menacing.\n\nThe rat carries a cloud of horrible stench with it, it's overpoweringly strong up close.\n\nDark ooze dribbles from the rat's mouth, it eats through the floor but seems to dissolve in water.
actors.mobs.fetidrat.discover_hint=You can find this enemy during a specific quest.

actors.mobs.fungalcore.name=fungal core
actors.mobs.fungalcore.desc=This gigantic mushroom must be the source of all the fungal activity in this cave.

actors.mobs.fungalsentry.name=fungal sentry
actors.mobs.fungalsentry.desc=This especially tall mushroom acts as a point of defense for the larger fungal network living in this cave.\n\nIt is immobile, but will shoot precise blasts of poison at anything that gets within its line of sight. While the impact of these blasts is fairly weak, _they can stack up deadly amounts of poison very quickly._ While it can be killed, it's probably best to avoid it.

actors.mobs.fungalspinner.name=fungal spinner
actors.mobs.fungalspinner.desc=This cave spinner appears to be being controlled by a parasitic fungus. The fungus has also changed its abilities, replacing its web and venom sacks with fungal growth.\n\nThe fungal spinner will spit plant life at you instead of webs, spreading fungal vegetation and potentially rooting you. While it can't poison, the fungal spinner will gain substantial damage resistance if it is adjacent to any mushrooms.

actors.mobs.ghoul.name=prototech ghoul
actors.mobs.ghoul.desc=As prototech society slowly began to collapse, and the current leader of the prototechs seized absolute power, those who were weak or who resisted him were not treated well. As the leader grew more adept at wielding dark energy, he bent these prototechs to his will, and now they make up the footsoldiers of his army.\n\nGhouls are not especially strong on their own, but always travel in groups and are much harder to kill in large numbers. _When a ghoul is defeated, it will rise again after a few turns as long as another ghoul is nearby._

actors.mobs.gnoll.name=gnoll scout
actors.mobs.gnoll.desc=Gnolls are hyena-like humanoids. They dwell in sewers and Stations, venturing up to raid the surface from time to time. Gnoll scouts are regular members of their pack, they are not as strong as brutes and not as intelligent as shamans.

actors.mobs.gnollexile.name=gnoll exile
actors.mobs.gnollexile.desc=This grey-furred gnoll has a large mark on its shoulder, denoting it as an exile. Gnolls are usually exiled from their society for ignoring orders or breaking laws. Exiles have to be strong and shrewd to survive, this one looks like it knows how to use the spear it's holding.
actors.mobs.gnollexile.desc_passive=_The gnoll exile isn't moving to attack._ It doesn't seem as aggressive as the other gnolls here, and probably doesn't think that fighting you is worth it. You could just let it pass, but it has a backpack that might be full of useful items...
actors.mobs.gnollexile.desc_aggro=_The gnoll exile looks around angrily._ It seems something has made it decide to fight after all. Watch out for that spear!
actors.mobs.gnollexile.seen_passive=The spear-wielding gnoll looks at you warily, but doesn't move to attack.

actors.mobs.gnollgeomancer.rock_kill=The flying boulder killed you...
actors.mobs.gnollgeomancer.rockfall_kill=The falling rocks killed you...
actors.mobs.gnollgeomancer.desc=This impressively tall senior gnoll must be the source of the various earth-moving technology around here, and the organizer of all the gnoll activity. Unlike the gnoll sappers in the area, the geomancer is quite adept with its magic, and cannot be damaged by thrown or falling rocks. It doesn't have any way to fight in melee combat though.
actors.mobs.gnollgeomancer.desc_armor=The geomancer is currently encased in a layer of rock armor. _You'll need to get up close and break it away with your pickaxe before you can damage the geomancer._
actors.mobs.gnollgeomancer.desc_armor_sapper=_A nearby gnoll sapper is holding a device that is empowering the geomancer's rock armor. You won't be able to damage it at all right now!_
actors.mobs.gnollgeomancer.desc_sleeping=This impressively tall gnoll shaman is surrounded by a layer of rock, and looks almost like a statue. Looking closely you can see the rock technologically move in time with the senior gnoll's breathing. It can't be harmed while encased in rock like this, and it appears to be enjoying a literal dirt nap.\n\nYou can probably break through the layers of rock with your pickaxe, but _be sure you're ready for a fight when you do so._ The geomancer must be the source of the various earth-moving technology around here, and the organizer of all the gnoll activity. _Defeating the gnolls scattered around here before fighting it might be a good idea._
actors.mobs.gnollgeomancer.discover_hint=You can find this enemy during a specific quest.

actors.mobs.gnollguard.name=gnoll guard

actors.mobs.gnollguard.spear_warn=The gnoll lands a vicious blow with the tip of its spear!
actors.mobs.gnollguard.desc=A large and tough looking gnoll wielding a spear and a shield, but no helmet. These guards are likely brutes in training, roped into helping protect the mine from encroaching wildlife.\n\nThe gnoll guard is strong enough to wield the spear in one hand, but can't use it very well. _It will need fairly open space to attack at a distance, and will do notably less damage to you if you get up close._
actors.mobs.gnollguard.desc_armor=_A nearby gnoll sapper is holding a device that is granting this guard earthen armor, heavily reducing the damage it takes._
actors.mobs.gnollguard.discover_hint=You can find this enemy during a specific quest.

actors.mobs.gnollsapper.name=gnoll sapper
actors.mobs.gnollsapper.desc=A small and weak but intelligent gnoll with pale fur and a satchel full of various gadgets. They are likely here to assist with prospecting and mining dark gold, and have a nearby guard for protection. They are capable of fighting, but their attacks are pitifully weak, no stronger than a gnoll scout.\n\nInstead of fighting directly, sappers prefer to use the various gadgets they have to make the rocky environment attack for them. They don't know earth-moving technology themselves though, and so are pretty likely to use their gadgets recklessly. _There should be lots of ways to use their attacks against them, or their guard._
actors.mobs.gnollsapper.discover_hint=You can find this enemy during a specific quest.

actors.mobs.gnolltrickster.name=gnoll trickster
actors.mobs.gnolltrickster.desc=A strange looking creature, even by gnoll standards. It hunches forward with a wicked grin, almost cradling the satchel hanging over its shoulder. Its eyes are wide with a strange mix of fear and excitement.\n\nThere is a large collection of poorly made darts in its satchel, they all seem to be tipped with various harmful substances.
actors.mobs.gnolltrickster.discover_hint=You can find this enemy during a specific quest.
