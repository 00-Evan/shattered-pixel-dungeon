scenes.introscene.text=Many years ago, Pixel Kingdom was enveloped by a dark magic, which made all the creatures in it wild and full of rage. A brilliant wizard, Yendor, created a powerful artifact - an amulet that could absorb this dark magic from a creature and store it inside itself.\n\n"No biggie", said Yendor, "I'm just gonna save the world!"\n\nYendor went about the country, curing all the creatures she could find, until they were all restored, and the amulet was full. Yendor and her fellow wizards created a vault deep underground where the amulet could be stored, for they had not yet devised a way to safely destroy it.\n
scenes.introscene2.text=Since that time, the vault became damaged, and the dark magic began to leak out, infesting the subterranean creatures. Fortunately, the wizards had not been idle. They had devised an enchantment that could change ordinary weapons so that they would absorb dark magic from creatures instead of injuring them.\n\nOnce a creature has been completely cured, it can be beamed to the surface, rehabilitated, and release into the wild. But someone has to go underground to clean the dark magic from these creatures.\n\nGuess what - they picked you!\n
scenes.introscene3.text=Travel underground, curing whatever creatures you find. Then, make your way to the vault, retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, and return it to the surface so its magic too can be cleansed.\n\nDon't be too concerned about being attacked by the creatures below - if you are defeated, you will be beamed to the surface, healed, and you can try again, without your stuff, but maybe a little wiser, or at least more careful!\n\nNo biggie, you're just gonna save the world!\n
