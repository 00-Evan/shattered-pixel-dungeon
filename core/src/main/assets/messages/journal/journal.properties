journal.document.adventurers_guide.title=Tome of Dungeon Mastery
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.title=Introduction
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.body=Greetings Adventurer, you are reading the Tome of Dungeon Mastery. This book is full of tips and tricks to help budding adventurers survive and excel!\n\nThis guide is best used as a reference, and will magically let you know when is the best time to read each page.\n\n(Whenever the journal icon at the top-right blinks, the guidebook has something to tell you! Some pages seem to be ripped out of the book though, perhaps you can find them in the dungeon?)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining.title=Examining
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining.body=Rushing into enemies is almost never the best way to deal with them. It's important to study your opponents and surroundings to learn how to defeat them!\n\nExamining things also takes no time, so get in the habit of doing it to everything new you encounter.\n\n(You can examine something by using the magnifying glass button, and selecting the thing you want to examine. You can also examine buffs or debuffs by selecting their icons.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.title=Surprise Attacks
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.body=You're guaranteed to hit an enemy if you surprise them by attacking from outside of their view, or right as you enter their view.\n\nEven the most evasive enemies can't dodge a surprise attack, which makes them very useful against enemies like wraiths and snakes.\n\nOne of the most common parts of the environment you can use to surprise enemies is a door. If an enemy chases you through a door you can attack them right after they enter it and catch them by surprise!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.title=Identifying Items
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.body=You won't know all of the properties of some items when you first find them.\n\nThe colors of potions and symbols on scrolls are different in each dungeon. Unidentified equipment can be upgraded or enchanted if you're lucky, or it might be cursed!\n\nScrolls of identify, upgrade, or remove curse are very useful if you want to reduce the risk of using unidentified equipment.\n\n(You can find a list of all the items you've identified in the items tab of your journal)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.title=Dealing with Hunger
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.body=Rationing food effectively is one of the best things you can do to improve your odds of survival. Try thinking of health and hunger as resources that need to be managed, not kept full at all times.\n\nWhen you aren't starving you will slowly regenerate health. So if you eat at full health, this regeneration will be wasted.\n\nIf you pace out when you eat based on how your health is doing, your food should last much longer.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.title=Handling Defeat
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.body=Unfortunately, dungeoneering is a very dangerous profession and most adventurers will eventually meet their demise.\n\nWhile luck can definitely play a role, the best adventurers are the ones who use every little trick to improve their odds of success.\n\n(Don't be dissuaded if you are dying a lot, this game is hard! Focus on learning the game and steadily improving, don't focus on winning right away.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.searching.title=Searching
journal.document.adventurers_guide.searching.body=Dungeons are full of secret doorways and traps which appear invisible at first glance. Searching takes time, but is very useful if you suspect something is hidden.\n\nSearch near walls if you suspect a door is hidden, or around floors if you suspect a trap is hidden.\n\n(You can search all the tiles around you by using the magnifying glass button twice. Anything that's hidden in these tiles will be revealed. Maybe there are some hidden doors near where you found this page!)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.title=Strength
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.body=There won't be any time to train with weapons and armor you find in the dungeon, so you'll need brute strength to use them effectively.\n\nPotions of strength and scrolls of upgrade are the most effective way to meet the strength requirements of higher tier gear.\n\nIt's important to work towards using high tier items, but don't completely ignore equipment you can use sooner. Once you're deep enough in the dungeon you'll need high tier gear to survive, but you have to survive long enough to equip them first!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.upgrades.title=Upgrades
journal.document.adventurers_guide.upgrades.body=The deeper you go into a dungeon, the more important it is that you're using magically enhanced high tier gear.\n\nHigher tier weapons and armor gain more power from upgrades, but you'll also need the strength to use them properly. Wands, rings, and artifacts don't need strength, but have limited usages or don't help as directly in combat.\n\nMaking good choices about what you upgrade is very important for surviving early in the dungeon, and for setting yourself up for success later in the dungeon.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.title=Effective Looting
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.body=Specific rooms will often contain better loot. Some of these rooms will be behind locked doors, or will contain obstacles which must be overcome.\n\nWhenever an obstacle blocks your progress, look for a solution nearby. You can usually find an item to help you on the same floor.\n\nPotions of strength and scrolls of upgrade are an excellent benchmark of how well you're exploring and looting. You will be able to find 2 potions of strength and 3 scrolls of upgrade in each five floor dungeon region.\n\n(You can see a list of important landmarks and unused keys in the notes tab of the journal window.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.title=Gaining Experience
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.body=Your experience level boosts your accuracy, evasion, health, and awards talent points. All of these can make a big difference in combat. It's best to have at least one level for each floor of the dungeon.\n\nIt can be tempting to rush through a dungeon, avoiding exploration and combat, but doing so will deprive you of both supplies and experience.\n\n(You can see information about your hero, including exp, on the status pane at the corner of the game interface. Select your hero portrait to get even more info.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.positioning.title=Positioning
journal.document.adventurers_guide.positioning.body=Effectively fighting enemies depends on good strategy as well as strong equipment. Bad situations like getting surrounded can usually be avoided with good positioning.\n\nFor instance, most dungeons have thin corridors, which are excellent at forcing enemies to fight you one at a time. These corridors often have doorways too, which can be used for surprise attacks!\n\nThere are lots of little ways to use environmental features like grass, water, or traps to your advantage as well.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.title=Magical Attacks
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.body=Magical attacks cut right through armor and are extremely difficult to dodge. This means that your wands will be very reliable, but also makes magical enemies extremely dangerous!\n\nMagical attacks always have a drawback though. Wands have limited charges and magical enemies usually won't be able to use their magic in close range.\n\nWhen facing enemies that use magic it is important to learn how to prevent them from using it on you.

journal.document.alchemy_guide.title=Alchemy Guide
journal.document.alchemy_guide.potions.title=Intro and Potions
journal.document.alchemy_guide.potions.body=Welcome to Practical Applications of Alchemy!\n\nAlchemy recipes can be used to craft a wide variety of items at an alchemy pot. You can experiment to find recipes, or continue reading this book for a full recipe reference!\n\nWe will start with the most iconic alchemy recipe: Place any three seeds into an alchemy pot to brew a random potion!\n\nEvery seed has a potion counterpart, and the potion you create may relate to one of the seeds used. Using multiple of the same seed will increase the chance for this to occur.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.stones.title=Creating Runestones
journal.document.alchemy_guide.stones.body=Mixing a scroll into an alchemy pot will imbue its magic into two rocks within the pot. This creates runestones!
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy_food.title=Energy and Food
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy_food.body=Many recipes require crystalized alchemical energy, which is produced by deconstructing most consumable items in an alchemy pot. As a few examples: seeds generate 2 energy, stones generate 3, scrolls and potions each generate 6.\n\nSome of these recipes are quite magical, but these ones more resemble traditional cooking.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_potions.title=Exotic Potions
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_potions.body=Potions can be mixed with energy to create exotic potions. They have more powerful effects, but are often useful in different ways.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_scrolls.title=Exotic Scrolls
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_scrolls.body=Exotic scrolls can be made with some energy and a scroll. They're a bit stronger and more expensive than exotic potions.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.bombs.title=Enhanced Bombs
journal.document.alchemy_guide.bombs.body=A standard black powder bomb can be mixed with a specific item to create an enhanced bomb.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.weapons.title=Enhancing Weapons
journal.document.alchemy_guide.weapons.body=Some of the lighter or more magical weapons can be used in alchemy!\n\nEach thrown weapon produces enough liquid metal to fully repair another weapon of the same level and tier.\n\nOne wand will produce enough arcane resin to upgrade two wands of the same level, but no higher than +3.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.catalysts.title=Catalysts
journal.document.alchemy_guide.catalysts.body=Catalysts are made by combining a scroll or potion with a single seed or runestone. If the pair of items match, the alchemical energy cost is removed.\n\nCatalysts are most useful as components in recipes covered in the next two pages, but also can be used in a pinch for a random effect.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.brews_elixirs.title=Brews and Elixirs
journal.document.alchemy_guide.brews_elixirs.body=Brews and elixirs are advanced potions which provide a variety of effects with a single use.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.spells.title=Spells
journal.document.alchemy_guide.spells.body=Spells are contained in crystals and provide a variety of effects with multiple uses.

journal.document.intros.title=Region Introductions
journal.document.intros.dungeon.title=Dungeon
journal.document.intros.dungeon.body=Many heroes have ventured into the dungeon before you from the city above, most have never been heard from again.\n\nIt is said that an ancient evil lurks in the depths, guarding the almighty Amulet of Yendor. Even now dark energy radiates from below, making its way up into the city.\n\nWill you conquer the dungeon and claim the amulet? It's time to start your own adventure!
journal.document.intros.sewers.title=Sewers
journal.document.intros.sewers.body=The upper floors of the dungeon actually constitute the city's sewer system.\n\nAs dark energy has crept up from below the usually harmless sewer creatures have become more and more ferocious. The city has had to send guard patrols down here to try and maintain safety for those above.\n\nThis place is dangerous, but at least the evil magic at work here is weak.
journal.document.intros.prison.title=Prison
journal.document.intros.prison.body=Many years ago a prison was built here to house dangerous criminals. Tightly regulated and secure, convicts from all over the land were brought here to serve time.\n\nBut soon dark miasma started to creep from below, twisting the minds of guard and prisoner alike.\n\nIn response to the mounting chaos, the city sealed off the entire prison. Nobody knows what became of those who were left for dead within these walls...
journal.document.intros.caves.title=Caves
journal.document.intros.caves.body=These sparsely populated caves stretch down under the abandoned prison. Rich in minerals, they were once a center of bustling trade and industry for the dwarven society below, but they were abandoned as the dwarves became obsessed with dark magic.\n\nThe caves are now mostly inhabited by subterranean wildlife, gnolls, and derelict machinery; likely corrupted by the same power that has affected the regions above.
journal.document.intros.city.title=Dwarven Metropolis
journal.document.intros.city.body=The Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of all dwarven city-states. In its heyday the dwarves built wondrous machines of metal and magic that allowed their city to expand rapidly.\n\nThen, one day, the city gates were barred and nobody heard from the dwarves again. The few who escaped the city as it closed told stories of a mad warlock who stole the throne, and the terrible magic he had learned to harness.
journal.document.intros.halls.title=Demon Halls
journal.document.intros.halls.body=These deep halls of the Dwarven Metropolis have been twisted by dark magic. In the past these regions played host to the Dwarf King's court of elite warlocks, but now they seem to have been taken over by something even more sinister...\n\nAll sorts of horrific demonic creatures inhabit these halls, being led by some terrible dark power. If the King of Dwarves wasn't the source of the spreading corruption, whatever is down here must be.\n\nTread carefully, very few adventurers have ever descended this far...

journal.document.sewers_guard.title=Sonia's letters
journal.document.sewers_guard.new_position.title=My New Position!
journal.document.sewers_guard.new_position.body=85th of Autumn, 375\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nI told you all the hard work at the city guard would pay off. I just got promoted!\n\nI've been invited to join a specialist team that works in the sewers. Apparently there are problems with vermin and outlaws down there, and its our job to clear them out. It's messy work, but the sewers are warm in the winter and it pays three times as much as regular guard duty!\n\nIt's all a bit secretive though, so I can't actually send this letter. It feels weird to not write to you, so I'm going to keep writing them anyway. Maybe I can show them to you one day.\n\nBest,\n- Sonya
journal.document.sewers_guard.dangerous.title=A Dangerous Position...
journal.document.sewers_guard.dangerous.body=88th of Autumn, 375\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nI understand why the pay is so good now, the sewers are infested with monsters! The 'vermin' and 'outlaws' are giant bloodthirsty rats and packs of angry gnolls.\n\nThankfully the rest of my team really knows what they're doing. Our team captain, Thomas, is an expert at this. I'm trying to learn quickly so that I'm not too much of a burden.\n\nThis job is a lot more dangerous than I thought. I'm glad I can't send these now, I don't want you to worry.\n\nI'll keep safe,\n- Sonya
journal.document.sewers_guard.crabs.title=Giant Crabs!
journal.document.sewers_guard.crabs.body=11th of Winter, 376\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nAs if the rats weren't bad enough, deeper down there are giant crabs! One of them charged right past me and got Lee pretty badly before we killed it. Thomas says it's not my fault, but I know he's just trying to be nice to me.\n\nThankfully, on our way out we ran into an adventurer who had some spare sungrass salve. Lee might not have made it without that stuff.\n\nI saw the adventurer staring at a rose before they left, they said it was a gift. Why would they risk their life down here if someone cares about them so much?\n\nThat's exactly what I'm doing isn't it? I feel like I'm in over my head.
journal.document.sewers_guard.guild.title=The Thieves' Guild
journal.document.sewers_guard.guild.body=23rd of Winter, 376\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nNo new monsters this time, instead we ran into a small group from the thieves' guild while on patrol.\n\nEverything I've heard about the guild is bad, but the rest of my team seemed almost friendly with them. Thomas exchanged information and supplies with one of them before we went our separate ways.\n\nI don't understand, weren't we supposed be getting rid of outlaws? Thomas even said not to mention this to anyone in command. Their information and supplies were very useful though, and we couldn't handle even more fighting.\n\nI suppose we're all in this together down here.
journal.document.sewers_guard.lost.title=We're Lost
journal.document.sewers_guard.lost.body=40th of Winter, 376\n\nThomas and I are lost. We got driven away from the rest of the team while fighting some gnolls. Neither of us are hurt, but the lower sewers are like a maze.\n\nThomas says he knows a route out, but it starts at the old prison entrance at the bottom of the sewers. I really don't like going deeper, but we don't have any rations and going down is much faster than wandering around looking for our patrol route.\n\nIt'll be alright. Thomas knows what he's doing.
journal.document.sewers_guard.not_worth.title=It's not worth it
journal.document.sewers_guard.not_worth.body=Thomas and I ran into some sort of massive ooze monster at the prison entrance. Before we could react it blasted us with magic. Thomas took most of it. He's gone.\n\nNo amount of money is worth this. I'm going to leave through the route Thomas told me about. Then I'll take what I've earned as a guard and use it to move my parents and I away from this cursed city. Part of me wants to hope that the King has a plan for all this, but I doubt it.\n\nI'm leaving these letters behind as a warning to others. It's more than just giant rats and crabs, something is very wrong down here.
